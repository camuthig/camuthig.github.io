My name is Chris Muthig, and I am a software developer with a passion for helping others get more out of technology.
I have worked in a number of different domains, and I'm always looking for new systems I can build
to solve problems people face every day.

I have worked in a number of different languages over the years and believe that programming languages are just a tool to
solve complex problems. You'll often see me experimenting with new languages and trying out new development paradigms to see
if they can better solve certain problems I may come across.

On January 2, I began a experience in my career by going 100% remote. In fact, I went pretty extreme with the experience,
and my wife and I moved to Australia for her work for several months, starting in later January. I am just over two
months into this experience and I decided it would be wise to take a second and document my thoughts.

## Office Setup

The setup of my office is very specific to the living situation I find myself in. First it is temporary - we will only
be here for a few months. Second, it is a shared living space. We have two roommates, so anything I do for my office
needs to be respectful of their space as well. For these reasons combined, I'm generally doing my work from the 
kitchen table in our apartment while everyone else is at work, using the chairs available to me. The height of the chair nor the table is ideal, and
it has made me recognize just how important a customized work environment is. I also miss
my standing desk at home. The freedom to stand or sit based on one's mood or current comfort level is something that should 
not be taken for granted.

Aside from that, I believe my development setup is working out well. I have:

* My WASD TKL keyboard (dragged with me all the way from California)
* A wrist rest
* The laptop I am using (either my 15" 2015 MBP or my Lenovo X1 Extreme)
* A mouse (Magic Mouse with the MPB and a Deathadder with the Lenovo)
* A [Roost laptop stand](https://www.therooststand.com/collections/roost-laptop-stand/products/roost-laptop-stand)

The Roost laptop stand is a bit expensive, but for anyone that finds themselves in a position where they will be
working solely from a laptop for large periods of time, it is worth it. At times I do with the heights settings were a
bit more configurable, but the device is incredibly small when packed and trustworthy when in use. When your laptops
cost as much as mine do, trustworthy is very important.

## Dealing with Time Difference

Most of my company is located in California, but about half of the engineering team is spread across the West Coast
and the East Coast. At the time of writing this post, I am generally working 5.5/8.5 hours behind my coworkers - but
I'm on the next day. So when I start work on Tuesday morning at 7 AM, my East Coast counterparts are seeing 3:30 PM,
Monday. With the fast approaching DST change, that difference will increase by two hours over the next three weeks. All
this to say, the time difference is actually a challenge.

I've found I really enjoy starting my week one day before the rest of my company. It gives me a great chance to pick up
work that I know will need a good deal of focus to accomplish and see it through to the end. When the rest of my team
starts their Monday, I will have my pull requests published and ready for their review.

It is, however, difficult starting my day when so many of my coworkers are fully in the swing of things. I've come
across a couple of different challenges in this respect.

First, when I start my day 4-7 hours after my coworkers, it means there has been a lot of time for things to happen.
This is especially pertinent if I am the lead on a project and therefore a lot of the questions regarding that project
go through me. I might open my laptop to a handful of new direct messages in Slack or certain channels with 100+ new
messages for me to comb through.

The second issue I have faced, is that it can be difficult to work alongside my teammates to solve problems or complete
standard flow, like pull requests. The process of a pull request, becomes much more asynchronous, which is common in
open source world, but less so within a company, where most coworkers may be able to make a couple of review interations
on the same pull request within the same day. In this regard, I believe I have seen some decline in my overall velocity,
but it is likely a problem that I can figure out, given the time.

To tackle these problems, I have been restructuring how I think about my day. The general outline of the day is:

* 6:00 AM - 8:00 AM: Engineering team work - pull requests, technical specifications, troubleshooting development issues with my east coast teammates
* 8:00 AM - 10:00 AM: Product work - reviewing new product specifications, supporting QA, triaging bugs, sprint planning work
* 10:00 AM - End of Day: The good stuff - focused programming work, testing large project changes,  writing technical specs

My company relies heavily on Slack for messaging, and I have found the "Unread Messages", as suggested by my manager",
allows me to slowly work my way through messages that may or may not be important to me when there are hundreds without
losing any of them. I've also found it very important to respond to others early and give them some scope of when a
response may be coming. Just a quick "Hey, I just saw your message and have a few things to take care of, but I will get
back to you later this morning." Really just something so that they know it hasn't been missed. 

The downside of this working schedule is that it is the reverse of what I prefer. I usually start my work day before others,
between 7:00 AM and 8:00 AM when I'm home, and find I am most productive in the first few hours of my day. This new
schedule takes that time at which I am at my best and requires using it for work that requires me less "at peak". I'm
still trying to work through how to best handle this, but for now, I am trying to take advantage of my Mondays by myself
as much as possible to make up for the change in my schedule.

## Face to Face Meetings

The way my team is setup, we don't have many meetings, which is a good thing. I participate in maybe two meetings per
week, and I am doing my best to keep my webcam on when in those meetings, bandwidth allowing. I don't know if it matters
to the other people in the meeting, but it makes things feel a bit more real to me, and it means I have to stay focused
during these short meetings, helping us make the most of the time.

I have a weekly one-on-one with my manager that is now a remote experience, and I am still trying to get used to that.
In the past it has been a very casual affair, going for a walk to grab a cup of coffee, and talking about different
things along the way. I enjoy that format for a one-on-one, so I am trying to keep a similar feel to it. I usually
grab a cup of coffee just before we start out video call, and I try to start out with some minor chit chat before we
discuss anything too serious. I think the format works just as well, but it is still something I'm getting used to.

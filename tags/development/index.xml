      <description>I have only been a professional Python developer for three months. I made this transition after several years in the PHP ecosystem, and I am still learning some nuances of Python. One area I have found very challenging is version and dependency management. I think it has been hard for me because it was a pretty simple concept in PHP. For versions, I didn&amp;rsquo;t often change them, but when I did, I would usually unlink the current PHP binaries and link up new ones through some sort of script.</description>

      <title>Developing on Windows Using WSL 2</title>

      <description>I just ran across this draft on my machine after several months (I wrote this in January), so hopefully it is clean enough and I believe the information is still up to date.
Below are my thoughts and experience setting up and testing the use of Window&amp;rsquo;s WSL 2 system for development work. The findings are based on running a production-ready Django application, but only doing minor modifications to test how the development flow works.</description>

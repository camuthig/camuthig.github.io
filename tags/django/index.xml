      <description>I recently needed to implement a special kind of field in Django Rest Framework that turned out to be a fun experiment. I recreated this in a simple Django application, and the bulk of the DRF-related code can be found here.
First, the API used a hashed ID. So the primary key from the database was taken, additional information added to it and then hashed.
Second, the API to set the relationship value behaved differently than when reading it.</description>

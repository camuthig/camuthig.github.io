      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with .NET recently to see if I like it as a strongly typed web framework. One issue I ran into though, was that the naming conventions with Entity Framework leverage pascal case. I appreciate that this closely matches the code, but I have been using Postgres for my database of choice lately and case-sensitive naming is a pain in that environment.
I found like-minded individuals discussing options in GitHub issues and blogs, and really appreciated the insights.</description>

            I finished my time working from Australia on May 10, making it just over three months of that I spent working from a siginificantly different (8+ hours) time zone than many of my coworkers. In my last post discussing this topic, I covered some of the pain points this time difference created, and I would like to discuss what worked well for me and what might have been better during that time.

        <p>
            Just over one month ago, my wife and I moved to Australia temporarily. We will be here for three or four months, and during that time, I will continue working for my company back in the United States. This means I am working remotely, but more importantly that I am working with a large time difference between myself and my coworkers. My coworkers are split between the East Coast (engineering team) and West Coast (product teams) of the United States, so I am 8.

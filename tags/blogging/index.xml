      <description>I have enjoyed using Hugo to build my blog, but I have not been happy with the deploy process to GitHub Pages. GitHub user pages always deploy the master branch of the project and also does not directly support Hugo. This means you need at least two branches to make this work, one for the source and one for the release. Up to this point, I was using the pattern suggested by the Hugo team for this.</description>
